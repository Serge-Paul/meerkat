Introducing Meerkat

While there are a lot of tools for software engineers for tracking stories, tasks, issues, and bugs, there are few tools for product managers. In many cases, product managers have to developed many documents and uploaded them on a wiki.

Meerkat intends to change that :)

Meerkat provides a complete tool for product managers to manage the product life cycle. Meerkat features include:
- product use cases
- product requirements
- product architecture and design
- product features
- road map and key milestones
- releases
- bugs
- beta testing
- team members

All those features are provided in an easy-to-use workflow through a Web interface.
