Introducing Meerkat

While there are a lot of tools for software engineers for tracking stories, tasks, issues, and bugs, there are very few tools for product managers. 

In many cases, product managers have to developed many documents and uploaded them on a wiki to share them accross an organization.

Meerkat intends to change that :)

Meerkat provides a complete tool for product managers to manage the product life cycle. 

Meerkat include everything that a product manager needs to document, track, and share about his product for his team:
- product use cases
- product requirements
- product design and architecture
- product features
- road map and key milestones
- releases
- bugs
- beta testing
- team members

All those features are provided in an easy-to-use workflow through a Web interface.

Meerkat runs on a Web server.
